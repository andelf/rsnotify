# Notify

__NOTICE: I need a usable-in-stable replacement for `stat.modified()` i.e.
a cross-platform way of getting the mtime of a file. Without that, I cannot
make this library work. I do not currently have the time to do it myself, so
*please help*. Thank you.__

_Cross-platform filesystem notification library for Rust._

## Install

```toml
[dependencies]
notify = "1.1"
```

Notify currently doesn't have working builds for stable version numbers, as
the notice above explains, some things are missing. However, `2.0.0-preN`
releases will be [published to crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/notify) for
the adventurous and those in need.

## Usage

```rust
extern crate notify;

use notify::{RecommendedWatcher, Error, Watcher};
use std::sync::mpsc::channel;

fn main() {
  // Create a channel to receive the events.
  let (tx, rx) = channel();

  // Automatically select the best implementation for your platform.
  // You can also access each implementation directly e.g. INotifyWatcher.
  let mut w: Result<RecommendedWatcher, Error> = Watcher::new(tx);

  match w {
    Ok(mut watcher) => {
      // Add a path to be watched. All files and directories at that path and
      // below will be monitored for changes.
      watcher.watch(&Path::new("/home/test/notify"));

      // You'll probably want to do that in a loop. The type to match for is
      // notify::Event, look at src/lib.rs for details.
      match rx.recv() {
        _ => println!("Recv.")
      }
    },
    Err(e) => println!("Error")
  }
}
```

## Platforms

- Linux / Android: inotify
- ~~All platforms: polling~~ (not working, see notice)
- Coming soon: OS X using FSEvent

### Todo

- Windows: ReadDirectoryChangesW
- OS X: FSEvents
- BSD / OS X / iOS: kqueue
- Solaris 11: FEN

## Known Bugs

- ~~polling backend only handles `op::WRITE`s~~ (poll implementation scrapped for the moment)
- see `TODO` and `FIXME` comments in the code for more

Pull requests and bug reports happily accepted!

## Origins

Inspired by Go's [fsnotify](https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify), born out
of need for [cargo watch](https://github.com/passcod/cargo-watch), and general
frustration at the non-existence of C/Rust cross-platform notify libraries.
